# Hags & Hexxes (Working Title)

A simple (so far) top-down video game built from the ground up using Java. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of game design. This is the reason that I decided to not use an engine for my first game project â€” I wanted to learn how to do the most simplest of things, like moving a character on the screen or displaying updating text.
